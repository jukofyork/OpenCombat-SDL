		 * Charisma is a measure of how well liked this soldier/commander is. A
		 * commander with a high charisma can get his soldiers to give that little 
		 * extra effort, to fight just that much harder. Likewise, a soldier with
		 * a low charisma can affect unit morale, or a commander with a low
		 * charisma is at risk of having his soldiers mutiny, or worse, frag him.

		 * Knowledge is a measure of the tactical skill of a commander. A commander
		 * with a high knowledge rating will use a variety of different elements
		 * in planning an attack (terrain, cover, force disposition, etc). Often
		 * this shows up as more finesse in an attack and a desire to minimize
		 * casualties while still achieving the objectives. A less knowledgeable
		 * commander has a tendency to use simplistic tactics and brute force,
		 * prefering direct assaults irregardless of the casualties sustained.
		 * Knowledge is an attribute that can increase with experience.

		 * when determining strategies and executing orders. They know what works
		 * and what to avoid. Experienced soldiers are less prone to the stress
		 * of battle. They fire more accurately, follow orders more closely, and
		 * are less likely to break or cower. Experienced soldiers, however, are
		 * less likely to follow incompetent commanders.
